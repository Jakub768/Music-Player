# Music-Player

Music Player is a simple tool which lets you play any kind of music you wish. This app has been built using C# .NET WPF forms. 
It is currently WIP but the final version will include:
- Loading music files into a list
- standard buttons for skipping, adding/removing music into/from the list and et cetera.
- Accessibility options.
